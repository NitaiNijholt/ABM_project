## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the grading scheme for the ABM project course. In total, the project accounts for 70% of the course grade.

The submission includes two parts:
- A report in the ODD+D format [1]
- The code of your model with comments and instructions

The grading scheme is divided into three parts:
- **Overall Achievement (30%)** - a single score indicating the amount of work achieved and the effort made. This is assessed by looking at the project as a whole and what was achieved.
- **Report (45%)** - An assessment of the submitted report (see section 2)
- **Presentation (10%)** - An assessment of the presentation (see section 4)
- **Code/Implementation (15%)** - An assessment of the submitted code and its features (see section 3)

## 2. Report

The report for the thesis should follow the ODD+D format, please read [1] for the details. The contents and structure of the report will be assessed according to the rubric in table 1. The three columns represent excellent, good and sufficient/poor. Within each scoring category, a final grade will be given somewhere in the specified range. The weighting of each category is provided in the final column.

### Table 1: Grading Rubric Report

| Criteria                     | Excellent (8-10)                                     | Good (6-7)                                             | Poor (5)                                    | Weight |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------|
| Problem statement            | Clearly, concisely and scientifically stated        | Stated, but slightly vague in parts                    | Poorly or not stated                       | 5%     |
| Background information       | Provided, complete but concise, well-structured overview of the topic | Provides good background, but perhaps verbose, incomplete, or suffers from poor flow | Important background missing              | 5%     |
| References/Literature        | All major literature is covered correctly           | Gets some literature but misses parts                  | Only provides minimal or unrelated literature | 10%    |
| Organisation/ODD format      | Follows ODD+D and paper is well organised            | Most of ODD+D, some sections misplaced                 | Either misses ODD+D or poorly structured paper | 5%     |
| Methodology (is the model clearly described) | Described to a standard that allows repetition of work | Most of the model components described, some missing | Major parts of the model missing or poorly described | 20%    |
| Experimental Design (is the right analysis done) | Experiments are clearly described and cover all important aspects | Experiments description is lacking or some important experiments missing | Poorly described and missing important parts | 20%    |
| Experimental Analysis (are the experiments done/analyzed right) | All experiments show excellent scientific analysis and statistics | Analysis is done, but missing statistical or scientific analysis | No analysis or very poor analysis | 20%    |
| Conclusions & future work   | Conclusions are strong and insightful, future work is clearly described | Conclusions are ok, some future work is mentioned     | Conclusions are missing or weak, future work poorly described | 10%    |
| Layout & Figures            | Report layout and typesetting is excellent           | Some parts of the layout/figures are weak              | Most of the report is poorly typeset and figures lack quality and labels/axes/etc | 5%     |

## 3. Code/Implementation

You will also be asked to submit your code to be assessed. This will be assessed for its features, working state and its relevance/contribution to the community. An excellent implementation should be to a standard that other students and or modellers can use it easily. You should make clear what parts of the code you have developed and which parts you have used from others. Please be sure to make clear any libraries that are required to run the simulation - the best way to do this is with a readme.

### Table 2: Grading Rubric Code

| Criteria                     | Excellent (8-10)                                     | Good (6-7)                                             | Poor (5)                                    | Weight |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------|
| Code Correctness             | Runs without issue and clear instruction            | Works with some minor changes or instructions unclear  | No clear instructions given                | 10%    |
| Readability                  | Code is well structured and easy to read             | Minor issues related to layout, naming of variables    | Significant issues with layout and naming  | 10%    |
| Design                       | Code is properly broken down into classes/methods/etc | Some methods/classes but some too long or over complicated | No real code design, one large file        | 10%    |
| Documentation                | Code is fully commented and comments are correct, readme included | Some functions/methods not properly commented          | Major parts of the code miss comments or many comments not updated | 20%    |
| Interface                    | Very nice interface for demonstrating the model (perhaps online) excellent teaching tool | Some nice features or basic Interface                  | Command line only                          | 15%    |
| Analysis Tools               | Code provides very nice features for analysing results/experiments | Code can generate output in some format other than plain text | Code prints to screen or unstructured plain text file | 15%    |

## 4. Presentation

Each group has 12 minutes to present + 3 minutes for questions on the final day.

The presentation should cover all the essential parts of the project:
1. What is the problem and Why is it important
2. What is (novel in) the approach (description of data/model)
3. What are the questions asked of the model (experiments)
4. Results
5. Conclusions and Future Work
